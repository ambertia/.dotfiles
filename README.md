## Amber's Hyprland Dotfiles
This is a collection of dotfiles and scripts intended to be used to apply all of my configured themes, settings, and base applications to an Arch Linux installation, inluding a Hyprland setup with necessary additions and configurations.

#### Arch Installation
The archfi script was used for Arch Linux installation, as well as some rudimentary configuration and installation of additional software.
